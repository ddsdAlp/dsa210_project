DSA210 - Introduction to Data Science Term Project

This project explores patterns and trends in my Youtube habits by analyzing my viewing history data.

## Motivation
A significant part of our lives are now lived through our phones, which is why I wanted to analyze my online behaviours and trends. I decided to choose an app that I use frequently whose data will tell a lot about myself, Youtube,
whose data offers a deep understanding about my habits and preferences.

I spend a lot of hours consuming content on Youtube, whether it be educational, sportive or entertaining. With this project, I aim to uncover some patterns behind the videos I watch, such as:

- What type of content do I watch
- Percentage of likes over videos viewed 
- Is there any preffered/favored content creators
- Daily/Weekly watching habits
- My subscriptions
- Search history

## Dataset
The dataset is easily obtained from Google Takeout with my Youtube Account.

The dataset includes:

- Viewing History
- Search History
- Subscriptions
- Liked Videos
- Comments and Live Chats
- Playlists

## Project Plan
1. Export and Prepare Data
   - Export data through Google Takeout

2. Visualization and Explarotary Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize the data with charts to show patterns, such as viewed content type or time of day habits
   - Identify patterns in viewing history
   - Analyze the aspects mentioned in the motivation part
